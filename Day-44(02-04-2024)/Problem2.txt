Q.) 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/description/ 
Solution:
M-1) Brute-Force: Linear Search
→ Traverse the array and for each character compare with the target character.
→ For the very first character which is just greater with the target is the answer.

Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(1)
===========
M-2) Optimal Solution: Using binary Search
→ CODE:
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = letters.length-1;
        int ans = 0;


        while(start<=end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(letters[mid]<=target){
                start = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                ans = mid;
                end = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return letters[ans];
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(log(N)), Space Complexity: O(1).
